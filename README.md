# Shape-Descriptor-Analysis-Project
Description:

This repository contains all the materials and code for my Shape Descriptor Analysis Project, a comprehensive study that involved applying shape descriptors—circularity, ellipticity, and rectangularity—to a curated dataset of images. The project was developed as part of my coursework in Image Processing and showcases the application of these shape descriptors to analyze and quantify the geometric properties of objects within digital images.

Contents:

- main.py: The Python script used for the analysis. This script processes the images to compute the shape descriptors, leveraging libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and pandas.
- results/shape_descriptors_results.csv: A CSV file containing the computed shape descriptor values for each image, neatly organized for easy analysis.
- Project_Report.pdf: A detailed report of the project, including the introduction, methodology, implementation details, results, and discussion of the findings
- images/: A directory containing sample images used in the study. (Note: due to privacy or copyright reasons, you might decide not to include actual images in the repository.)

This project illustrates the power of shape descriptors in image analysis, providing a foundational tool for tasks such as object recognition, classification, and digital image analysis in various applications.
